What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can work on it without internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	You could send files around and merge everythig manually.  Definitely a pain and strangers wouldn't be able to offer advice.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	Whenb you modify the code of other people and don't want to update the master out from other them.  And likewise when they update your code.
