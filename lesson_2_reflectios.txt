What happens when you initialize a repository? 

Git makes a hidden folder so you can get started creating the repository whenever you're ready.

Why do you need to do it?

This is the only way to start a repository. Git doesn't put every file in that folder into the repository because you may not want that.  It waits for you.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 

The staging area is an intermediate step where you can get all your ducks in a row before finalizing a commit.

What value do you think it offers?

It allows you to include some files but not others from the working directory in the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area lets you commit only one file at a time, so you can add a changed file and label the change for only that file.
